# BoarBot (Alpha v0.3.1)
This is a personal project I've set out to create for a Discord community. I've always wanted to make something that makes people happy, and this is it. BoarBot is intended to reach across as many Discord servers as possible, each able to configure BoarBot to however they see fit. The principle of least privilege is in practice with this bot. It will only ask for permissions that it absolutely needs.
## Commands
### /boar config
This command is used for the initial configuration of BoarBot in a Discord server. Currently only asks for a channel to handle trading, which channels commands can be used in, and if it's part of the Hypixel Skyblock community.

### /boar daily
This command is used to get your boar for the day. Some boars are rarer than others!

## Plans for the future
* Ability to focus on individual boars in `/boar collection`
* Powerups that spawn randomly but at the same time for all servers
* Leaderboards
* And more! (It's a secret)
